# BlueFound

This is my first project writed in Visual Basic, it's called Bluefound.

The original idea was to create an App that can communicates with Blietooth.
Doing this project I discovered that visual basic does not have the libraries to cammunicate with bluetooth.
So the original project was changed. 

The actual project allow you to write whatever you want inside the application and you can generate a simple 
Microsoft Word file that contains the same words (or phrases) that you wrote.
